# Hospitality-Analytics-Project
Data analysis project for AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain aimed at reversing a decline in market share and revenue. Developed an end-to-end dashboard using Power BI to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs), revenue trends, and property performance.

AtliQ Grands, a five-star hotel, faced challenges with decreasing market share and revenue due to increased competition and poor management decisions. I utilized Excel and Power BI to analyze revenue data, track performance metrics, and create a dashboard that provided actionable insights.
